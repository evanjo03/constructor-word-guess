# Constructor Word Guess
 
## Constructor Word Guess
This project was designed to further our understanding of Node.js, including modularization, as well as to introduce constructors in JavaScript.  We recreated a word guess game that we had developed for the web in Node, allowing the player to attempt to guess a word in a hangman-esque game in terminal or git bash.
