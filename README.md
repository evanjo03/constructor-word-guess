# Constructor Word Guess
 
## Constructor Word Guess
I created a word guess game in Node.js, allowing the player to attempt to guess a word in a hangman-esque game in terminal or git bash. This project helped further my understanding of Node.js and modularization, as well as to introduced constructors in JavaScript. I had created a similar application for the web already, so it was interesting to see how the design of the app changed when using constructors, and when the app was housed entirely in Node.js
